  <p><strong>The giraffe (Giraffa)</strong> is a genus of African even-toed ungulate mammals,
    the tallest living terrestrial animals and the largest ruminants. Taxonomic classifications
    of one to eight extant giraffe species have been described, based upon research into the mitochondrial
     and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements of Giraffa, but the International
      Union for Conservation of Nature currently recognises only one species, Giraffa camelopardalis,
      the type species, with nine subspecies. Seven other species are extinct,
      prehistoric species known from fossils. </p>
