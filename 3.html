  <p>The giraffe has intrigued various cultures, both ancient and modern,
    for its peculiar appearance, and has often been featured in paintings,
    books, and cartoons. It is classified by the International Union for Conservation
     of Nature as Vulnerable to extinction, and has been extirpated from many parts
     of its former range. Giraffes are still found in numerous national parks and
      game reserves but estimations as of 2016 indicate that there are approximately
       97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild. More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010.</p>
