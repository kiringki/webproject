  <p><strong>The giraffe (Giraffa)</strong> is a genus of African even-toed ungulate mammals,
    the tallest living terrestrial animals and the largest ruminants. Taxonomic classifications
    of one to eight extant giraffe species have been described, based upon research into the mitochondrial
     and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements of Giraffa, but the International
      Union for Conservation of Nature currently recognises only one species, Giraffa camelopardalis,
      the type species, with nine subspecies. Seven other species are extinct,
      prehistoric species known from fossils. </p>

  <p>The giraffe's <u>chief distinguishing characteristics</u> are its extremely
    long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns.
    It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative,
     the okapi. Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South
     Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east.
     Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves,
     fruits and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse
     at heights most other herbivores cannot reach. They may be preyed on by lions,
     leopards, spotted hyenas and African wild dogs. Giraffes live in herds of related
     females and their offspring, or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are
     gregarious and may gather in large aggregations. Males establish social hierarchies
     through "necking", which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon.
     Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility
     for raising the young. </p>

  <p>The giraffe has intrigued various cultures, both ancient and modern,
    for its peculiar appearance, and has often been featured in paintings,
    books, and cartoons. It is classified by the International Union for Conservation
     of Nature as Vulnerable to extinction, and has been extirpated from many parts
     of its former range. Giraffes are still found in numerous national parks and
      game reserves but estimations as of 2016 indicate that there are approximately
       97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild. More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010.</p>
